Lectures and problems of Introduction to Computing at Balseiro Institute  
Schedule of the subject:  

Introduction to algorithms.  
Decomposition of problems in subproblems.  
Sequential flow.  
Conditional flow.  
Repetitive flow.  
Search algorithms (about disordered sets and ordered sets).  
Sorting algorithms.  
Internal representation of data.  
Bit. Byte and its multiples.  
Representation of integers.  
Representation of negative integers.  
Floating point numbers.  
Representation error Propagation of errors.  
Computers. What do they really know how to do?  
Level of abstraction in the definition of a solution to a problem. Need to attack from a more abstract level.
